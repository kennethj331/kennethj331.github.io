            <h2>Myths and Misconceptions About Developer Productivity</h2>
            <p>
                A number of myths about developer productivity have accumulated over the years. Awareness of these
                misconceptions leads to a better understanding of measuring productivity.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Myth: Productivity is all about developer activity.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is one of the most common myths, and it can cause undesirable outcomes and developer
                    dissatisfaction. Sometimes, higher volumes of activity appear for various reasons: working longer
                    hours may signal developers having to "brute-force" work to overcome bad systems or poor planning to
                    meet a predefined release schedule. On the other hand, increased activity may reflect better
                    engineering systems, providing developers with the tools they need to do their jobs effectively, or
                    better collaboration and communication with team members in unblocking their changes and code
                    reviews.</p>

                <p>Activity metrics alone do not reveal which of these is the case, so they should never be used in
                    isolation either to reward or to penalize developers. Even straightforward metrics such as number of
                    pull requests, commits, or code reviews are prone to errors because of gaps in data and measurement
                    errors, and systems that report these metrics will miss the benefits of collaboration seen in peer
                    programming or brainstorming. Finally, developers often flex their hours to meet deadlines, making
                    certain activity measures difficult to rely on in assessing productivity.</p>

                <h2>
                    Myth: Productivity measures are useful only for managers.
                </h2>
                <p>Developers often say that productivity measures aren't useful. This may come from the misuse of
                    measures by leaders or managers, and it's true that when productivity is poorly measured and
                    implemented, it can lead to inappropriate usage in
                    organizations. It's disappointing that productivity has been co-opted this way, but it's important
                    to note that developers have found value in tracking their own productivity—both for personal
                    reasons and for communicating with others. By remembering that developer productivity is personal,7
                    developers can leverage it to gain insights into their work so they can take control of their time,
                    energy, and days. For example, research has shown that
                    high productivity is highly correlated with feeling satisfied and happy with work.12,20
                    Finding ways to improve productivity is also about finding ways to introduce more joy, and decrease
                    frustration, in a developer's day.</p>

            <h2> Myth: Productivity is only about engineering systems and developer tools.</h2>
            <p>While developer tools and workflows have a large impact on developer productivity, human
                factors such as environment and work culture have substantial impact too. Often the critical work needed
                to keep the environment and culture healthy can be "invisible" to many members of the organization or to
                metrics traditionally used for measuring productivity. Work such as morale building, mentoring, and
                knowledge sharing are all critical to supporting a productive work environment and yet are often not
                measured. The "invisible" work that benefits the overall productivity of the team is just as important
                as other more commonly measured
                dimensions.21
